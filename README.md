My thought process - 

1. Upon manually checking a couple of IP addresses, I noticed that the username and IP address are consistent. 
2. So, I wrote a script that takes in the log and creates a dictionary with uername as key and ip address as value. 
3. Lastly, I check if the ip address is already present in the dictionary or not. If not, I add it to the list of values. 
4. Whichever username has two distinct IP addressess will be the account that was accessed to download files. 
5. The offender is "dfardy9"

Synopsis of the downloaded data - 

1. The data contains the following PII information - first name, last name, email, gender, address, city, state, and credit card details.
2. The data is for 100 individuals.
